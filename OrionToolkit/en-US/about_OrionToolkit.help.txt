LONG DESCRIPTION
	A suite of tools to interact with the SolarWinds Orion API, via the SolarWinds Information Service (SWIS).

	Provides convenience wrappers around the first-party SwisPowerShell module.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
	The SolarWinds SDK (SwisPowerShell module) provides rudimentary tools to access to the SolarWinds API, which make getting useful info cumbersome.

	OrionToolkit aims to simplify common operations by wrapping those tools in a familiar PowerShell syntax.

	All cmdlets return objects that can be formatted, filtered, or passed to the pipeline.
